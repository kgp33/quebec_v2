# Quebec_v2 Project

## Introduction
Quebec_v2 is a financial analysis tool for Equity Portfolio Pricing.  Quebec_v2 prices stock portfolios and calculates the Sharpe Ratio of the given
portfolio. Portfolio data is provided in a specified .json format which allows quick and easy manipulation of portfolio data.

## Quickstart
The Quebec_v2 container image is available publically on Dockerhub.  Alternatively, you can clone the quebec_v2 repo [Here](https://github.com/kgp33/quebec_v2.git) and build the image locally.

### Install Docker

Here: [get docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

### Download image from dockerhub

ARM: `docker pull m1ntfish3r/quebec:arm`

AMD: `docker pull m1ntfish3r/quebec:amd`

### Alternatively build the image manually
`git clone https://github.com/kgp33/quebec_v2.git`ü¶Ñ

From the project Folder on your host machine:
`docker build -t image_name .`

### Run container

`docker run -it container_name/image_name`

ARM example: `docker run -it m1ntfish3r/quebec:arm`
AMD example: `docker run -it m1ntfish3r/quebec:amd`

> [!TIP]
> To exit the container shell:
> `exit`
> 
> To restart the contaier:
> `docker start -i container_name`
>
> Clear Docker cache and reset:
> `docker system prune -a`

### Prepare Input Data

Save your portfolio data as "stock.json" following the guidelines found in the [Quebec_v2 JSON Schema](https://github.com/kgp33/quebec_v2/blob/main/Schemas/stock-schema.json)

- Example: 
```ruby
[
    {
        "ticker": "AAPL", 
        "nShares": 10
    }, 
    {
        "ticker": "IBM",
        "nShares": 20
    },
    {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "nShares": 20
    },
    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "nShares": 20
    }
]
```

### Data Setup
Place properly formated JSON files in a file directory you can access from a terminal or cli.  
> [!NOTE]
> You will need the file path to the stock.json file to upload your data to the container.


### Upload specific portfolio data

To upload your portfolio data use the command below:
    `docker run -v /HOST/PATH: /CONTAINER/PATH -it <container_name>`

example:
    `docker run -v /Users/lindseybaucum/Desktop/stock.json:/quebec_v2/stock.json -it m1ntfish3r/quebec:amd`


### Running the Application

Once the container is running the price.py program can be run from the root directory.
`python3 PriceApp/price.py

> [!NOTE]
> To run the quebec_v2 test suite and ensure the application is performing as expected run `pyest`.
